    "### When to use Jupyter\n",
    "When to use Jupyter can easily derived from the advantages listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is very popular for teaching. The combination of code with explanations and the interactivity make it accessible to learners. Consider using it when you want to guide others through short pieces of code\n",
    "\n",
    "The other important use case is prototyping. You have seen in the plot example how we can iteratively adjust our code until it does the right thing. This is handy for plotting (and in fact the matplotlib documentation builds strongly on Jupyter notebooks) and even more useful for data-related tasks in general.\n",
    "Processing a dataset is often an iterative process and especially when loading the data takes considerable time, it is convenient to keep everything in memory while you trial-and-error your way through it. Likewise, Jupyter notebooks are popular for prototyping machine learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Jupyter is useful whenever you develop a new script and it is time-consuming or annoying to re-run the script everytime you make a mistake or want to change something.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to avoid Jupyter\n",
    "Finally, Jupyter notebooks are obviously not suitable for production in most cases. But once you have your prototype, you can just copy the code to Python and edit the few IPython-specific bits. There are even tools like _nbconvert_ that take this hassle from you.\n"
